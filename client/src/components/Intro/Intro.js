      I'm a Software Developer at TIAA.
      I currently work at TIAA as a developer on the Business Rule Management System Development team that is responsible for the decision logic layer of web and mobile apps.
      I contributed to the development and deployment efforts to migrate 30 apps from a legacy Business Rule Management System platform to using Red Hatâ€™s open source Decision Manager Platform.
      In addition, for this initiative I lead scrum, created stories in Jira, contributed to the development, and collaborated on solutions with QA and product teams.
