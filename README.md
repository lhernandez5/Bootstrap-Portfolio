# Portfolio
## New link to portfolio! https://obscure-everglades-64350.herokuapp.com/
<br>
<br>
This is my portfolio and it contains an about me section, my latest projects and information on how to get in contact with me. I built my portfolio using HTML, Javascript, Bootstrap CSS Framework, and React.js.
<br>
<br>
In my portfolio you can flip the cards with projects on them to see a description of them on the back, and a link to the deployed project. In the example below the Snippets card was flipped.
