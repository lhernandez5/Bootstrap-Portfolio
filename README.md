This is my portfolio and it contains an about me section, my latest projects and information on how to get in contact with me.

<br>
In my portfolio you can flip the cards with projects on them, or press the green arrow to see a description of the project on the back, and a link to the deployed project. In the example below the Snippets card was flipped.
